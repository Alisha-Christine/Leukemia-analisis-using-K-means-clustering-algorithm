<h2>Cancer Prediction Using Clustering Algorithm</h2>
<p>This project is used to analysis cancer using clustering algorithm. Here K-Means algorithm is opted in which the number of clusters, K is identified using Elbow and Silhouette methods where the leuanalysisNew.csv dataset is used that has data less than 30. Hopefully, this K-mean clustering algorithm could give better insights to predict cancer.</p>


<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

<p>As a pre-requisite we need python, jupyter notebook for coding and git hub to host this project. </br>
This project requires the dataset named leuanalysisNew.csv </p>

<h2>Installing</h2>
<p>Following python libraries was imported before starting the project.<p>
<Li>Pandas</li>
<Li>numpy</li>
<Li>matplotlib</li>
<p>sklearn is also used</p>

<h2>Running the tests</h2>
<p>Dataset was loaded initially and then scaled. Optimum number of clusters was identified using Elbow and Silhouette methods. Silhouette method could be executed more than 1 time to get better Silhouette co-efficients
</br>
Using K-means ploting we plotted dataset with 5 clusters and 2 clusters to get more idea about the datapoints.
